# Libft Project

Welcome to the Libft project! ðŸ“š

This project involves creating a library of useful standard functions that you will be able to reuse in various projects at 42 School.

## Project Overview

The library includes essential functions such as string manipulation, memory allocation, linked list operations, and more. Each function is implemented from scratch, providing a deeper understanding of their underlying mechanisms.

## Project Structure

The library is organized into individual `.c` files, each containing a specific function implementation. The `libft.h` file contains the function prototypes and relevant macros.

### Example Function Files:

- `ft_atoi.c`
- `ft_bzero.c`
- `ft_calloc.c`
- ...

## How to Use ðŸš€

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project folder.
3. Compile the library using the provided Makefile.
   ```bash
     $ make
   ```
Link the library with your project during compilation.
  ```bash
    $ gcc -o your_program your_source.c -L. -lft
  ```
Run your program.
  ```bash
    $ ./your_program
  ```

Happy coding! ðŸš€
